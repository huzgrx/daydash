# Daily Dashboard

First React project I've made, the idea is that it can be an alternative to default starting page in browser

Tech stack: HTML, SASS/Flexbox/Grid, React/Webpack

Changes to be done:
- refactoring code to use async/await and make it shorter, especially Weather.js
- adding new panel with common links
- improving UI on mobile
